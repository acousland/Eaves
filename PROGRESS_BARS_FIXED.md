# Progress Bar Suppression - Complete! ✅

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

The loading bars during audio transcription have been completely removed for a cleaner, real-time experience.

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### 1. **Environment Variable**
```python
os.environ['WHISPER_SUPPRESS_PROGRESS'] = '1'
```
Set at the module level to suppress Whisper's built-in progress tracking.

### 2. **Context Manager for Output Suppression**
```python
@contextmanager
def suppress_output():
    """Context manager to suppress stdout during model operations."""
    with open(os.devnull, 'w') as devnull:
        old_stdout = sys.stdout
        sys.stdout = devnull
        try:
            yield
        finally:
            sys.stdout = old_stdout
```

### 3. **Optimized Whisper Parameters**
```python
result = self.whisper_model.transcribe(
    audio_data, 
    verbose=None,  # Completely disable verbose output
    word_timestamps=False,  # Disable word-level timestamps
    condition_on_previous_text=False  # Don't use previous context
)
```

### 4. **Silent Transcription**
All transcription operations now happen within the `suppress_output()` context manager:
```python
with suppress_output():
    result = self.whisper_model.transcribe(...)
```
